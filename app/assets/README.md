# ASSETS

**This directory is not required, you can delete it if you don't want to use it.**

This directory contains your un-compiled assets such as LESS, SASS, or JavaScript.

More information about the usage of this directory in [the documentation](https://nuxtjs.org/guide/assets#webpacked).

For images please use the static folder instead. Images in this folder can only be called via <img /> nuxt will convert files in this folder to base64 then components will then render them. 

If you want to use <v-img /> consider placing the image in static and calling it using src
